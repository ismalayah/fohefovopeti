Upon meeting her, it was clear that she was someone else entirely, but their attraction didn’t dissipate — it magnified instead.</p><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=146 data-injectable=false>It’s like they were meeting the love of their lives for the first time all over again, discovering a new version of herself and her magic.</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=486 data-injectable=true>As dedicated <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fans of The Vampire Diaries</a> know, defining when Damon and Elena first got together isn’t an easy task. While fans quickly drew a line between being on Team Stefan or Team Damon, Elena explored her draw to both brothers; Damon and Stefan each brought out a very different side of her, and she wanted to embrace them both.</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>“It’s okay to love them both; I did,” Katherine told Elena during season 2 — and it’s an idea she carried with her throughout the series. Ultimately, Elena ended up with Damon, and while some of us have strong feelings about that — I’m still very much Team Stefan, thank you — it was a beautiful love story to witness.</p><p data-characters=365 data-current-count=720 data-injectable=true>Elena’s need to be near Damon began long before they officially chose one another, and their first kiss solidified that, which is something even a strong supporter of Stefan can admit to. So, to correctly answer the question of when they got together, we’ve got to look back at how their relationship evolved across every season of The Vampire Diaries.</p><h2 id=h-season-1-and-their-first-big-trip data-injectable=false>Season 1 (and their first big trip)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Vampire Diaries (@thecwtvd)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=698 data-injectable=true>Damon entered The Vampire Diaries as the ultimate bad guy; he was vengeful, hateful, and seemed to revel in causing pain. Damon hid behind a façade he built for himself and was an easy character to dislike. He used Elena’s friends to get close to her, went out of his way to make his brother’s life miserable, and almost gave away their big secret because he simply didn’t care.</p><p data-characters=215 data-current-count=215 data-injectable=false>Or so it seemed; Damon actually cared a lot, underneath the surface, of course. As the series progressed, viewers began to understand him a little bit better, and as we uncovered a new side of Damon, Elena did too.</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=445 data-injectable=true>The pair took a trip to help <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Elena deal with everything</a> unfolding before her, and they quickly began forming a close bond. It was a critical step in their future, laying the groundwork for the couple they would eventually become.</p><p data-characters=335 data-current-count=335 data-injectable=false>The pair also had an epic dance moment in the first season, when Stefan was so blood-thirsty that he couldn’t share the spotlight with his date. Damon saw his absence and moved in to save the day, and even if you are still on Team Stefan (we get it), you can’t deny the beauty and the chemistry they shared at that moment.</p><p data-characters=138 data-current-count=473 data-injectable=true>Where Elena ebbed, Damon flowed, and it is a stand-out moment — not just <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">within The Vampire Diaries</a>, but in the entirety of pop culture.</p><p data-characters=216 data-current-count=216 data-injectable=false>Damon, however, was still up to his antics —&nbsp;and Elena would soon continue her relationship with Stefan. Stefan was a safe place for Elena; he brought her a sense of comfort and compassion that was unmatched.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Season 2 (and the sort-of first kiss)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=516 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Vampire Diaries (@thecwtvd)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=true>Damon and Elena had their first kiss in the second season, so it’s clearly a vital moment for their future — but it wasn’t the epic first kiss that some fans anticipated. This kiss was during a pivotal moment for Damon; he thought he was dying (the forever kind of dying), and he confessed his love for Elena. Telling her that he knew it would always be Stefan for her, he still wanted Elena to know how much he loved her.</p><p data-characters=66 data-current-count=66 data-injectable=false>After telling him she knew, she planted a sweet peck on his lips.</p><p data-characters=108 data-current-count=174 data-injectable=false>While season 2 focused heavily on Stefan and Elena, that kiss would become a significant part of her story.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Season 3 (and Damon feels guilty)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=474 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by emilia | ae (@ogedakru)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=353 data-current-count=353 data-injectable=false>The porch is a special place for Damon and Elena, and there are a few moments in season 3 where they genuinely thrive. One is when the two share a special kiss after Damon says he’s tired of feeling guilty for wanting Elena. Instead of just wanting her, he decides to make a move — may as well give himself something to feel guilty about, right?</p><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=725 data-injectable=true>Their chemistry is off the charts, and even though we’re Team Stefan, we can’t deny the bond they’ve formed throughout the seasons. A lot of season 3 sees Damon and Elena trying to get back to Stefan, and even Damon helping the two get back together, but with Stefan acting very much unlike the guy she fell in love with, she draws even closer to Damon.</p><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=386 data-injectable=false>The two share more than one kiss through the third season, and their feelings grow stronger with each moment they share. Season 3 was a definite turning point for the pair, but they were still just friends at this point — even if they both wanted more. Elena still loved Stefan; was it really okay to love them both? She chose to be with Stefan, and a moment later, her life changed.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Season 4 (it’s official)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Vampire Diaries (@thecwtvd)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=394 data-current-count=394 data-injectable=false>Elena became a vampire in season 4, and as with any vampire, it heightened everything she was feeling, including her feelings for Damon. She left Stefan to be with Damon, and they were on fire; however, Damon began to doubt Elena’s feelings for him. Why the sudden change? Viewers discover that Elena is sired to Damon, and he wants her love for him to be pure and of her own discretion.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=695 data-injectable=true>It eats away at Damon for a long time, but Elena’s feelings don’t change. She loves Damon; she has always felt something for him, and it almost seemed that in season 2, when Katherine told her it was okay to love them both, she let that guard down and did just that. She loved Damon, too.</p><p data-characters=291 data-current-count=291 data-injectable=false>Later in season 4, Elena does confess her love to Damon, even after the sire bond is broken. The two share an intimate kiss in front of a fireplace, and it’s the epic moment Delena fans had always hoped for, the moment she made her final choice. Elena picked Damon; they were endgame.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Season 5 and beyond (it’s a forever kind of thing)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=591 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Vampire Diaries (@thecwtvd)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>While the two have ups and downs, they remain a strong couple in season 5. They attempt to leave one another, citing silly reasons that never actually keep them apart, before running back home. They’re in love, they’re bonded, and they’re living their dream. Of course, things don’t stay happily ever after for long, and season 6 brings Damon’s “death” (he’s actually trapped in another realm) which breaks Elena.</p><p data-characters=157 data-current-count=157 data-injectable=false>She wants to be rid of all memories of him, asking for her love for Damon to be erased, but as the series progresses, we see that she can’t escape him.</p><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=490 data-injectable=true>The two reunite in season 6, and she’s forgotten all of their beautiful times together, remembering only Damon’s shortcomings, but it doesn’t take long for the two to fall head over heels in love again. Their love is so powerful that it even survives Elena’s comatose state as she’s tethered to Bonnie.</p><p data-characters=399 data-current-count=399 data-injectable=false>Of course, that undying love didn’t mean it was easy for Damon to exist without Elena. In fact, he made some choices that left fans shaking their heads, and he was in a state of turmoil without her. Aside from Stefan, Elena was the one person who knew him in all of his forms — the one who gave him hope for tomorrow. Without the light in his life, he didn’t strive to avoid darkness.</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=763 data-injectable=true>While Elena is only present for one episode of the final season, it’s an impactful one. She appears in the series finale of The Vampire Diaries, and her reunion with Damon is next level. He was meant to forget their memories, but his heart kept her close. Damon loved Elena despite anything in the world that worked against them — natural or supernatural.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Vampire Diaries (@thecwtvd)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=396 data-current-count=696 data-injectable=true>The final episode also sees the couple making an important decision — to become human again. They want to live out the rest of their natural lives together, enjoying the world as a family and having a family — eventually growing old together. Growing old doesn’t happen for vampires; they remain the age they were when they were turned. The cure helped them get another chance at life.</p><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>A flash-forward shows Damon and Elena, surrounded by loved ones, married in their human forms. The ring on Elena’s hand proves the two took the steps they’d always dreamed of. It was a proper ending to a long-running series, and while Team Stefan fans always hoped it would be him at the end, Damon and Elena made sense. This happily ever after came true.</p><p data-characters=134 data-current-count=502 data-injectable=false>The Vampire Diaries is available for streaming on Peacock & Max if you wish to watch an epic love story from the beginning again.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMSnZJ2nXZmurrvNZpinnF2auaa6wGaenqxdqbyosdOhnKtlmaN6tbTEZq2apaCev6Z5w6KYq6GVqHw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./newsday-actor-epps-crossword-clue-puzzle-answers-1211474.html>&#171;&nbsp;Newsday Actor Epps Crossword Clue Puzzle Answers</a>
